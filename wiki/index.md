## Concepts

- [[LLM Wiki Pattern]] — the pattern for building persistent, compounding knowledge bases using LLMs (status: mature)
- [[Hot Cache]] — ~500-word session context file, updated after every ingest and session (status: mature)
- [[Compounding Knowledge]] — why wiki knowledge grows more valuable over time, unlike RAG (status: mature)
- [[cherry-picks]] — prioritized feature backlog from ecosystem research; 13 features to add to claude-obsidian (status: current)
- [[SVG Diagram Style Guide]] — canonical visual style for all diagrams: Space Grotesk, #0A0A0A dark theme, #E07850 accent, full design tokens (status: evergreen)
- [[Pro Hub Challenge]] — community challenge pattern for building claude-seo/claude-blog extensions; first challenge produced 6 submissions, 5 integrated in v1.9.0 (status: evergreen)
- [[Semantic Topic Clustering]] — SERP-based keyword grouping replacing paid tools; hub-spoke architecture with interactive visualization (status: evergreen)
- [[Search Experience Optimization]] — "read SERPs backwards" methodology for page-type mismatch detection and persona scoring (status: evergreen)
- [[SEO Drift Monitoring]] — "git for SEO" baseline/diff/track with 17 comparison rules and SQLite persistence (status: evergreen)
- [[DragonScale Memory]] — memory-layer spec inspired by the Heighway dragon curve; fold operator, deterministic page addresses, semantic tiling, boundary-first autoresearch (status: shipped v0.4, all four mechanisms opt-in)
- [[Persistent Wiki Artifact]]: durable Markdown page as the LLM's memory object, distinct from ephemeral chat turns (status: developing)
- [[Source-First Synthesis]]: provenance discipline; raw sources stay immutable while the wiki layer is synthesized and cited (status: developing)
- [[Query-Time Retrieval]]: wiki query path synthesizes with citations; complementary to Obsidian's in-vault search (status: developing)
